    <summary>
      The ITS model of radio propagation for frequencies between 20 MHz and 20 GHz (the Longley-Rice model) (named for Anita Longley &amp; Phil Rice, 1968) is a general purpose model that can be applied to a large variety of engineering problems. The model, which is based on electromagnetic theory and on statistical analyses of both terrain features and radio measurements, predicts the median attenuation of a radio signal as a function of distance and the variability of the signal in time and in space.
